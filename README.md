**I designed and developed the **front-end for an e-learning platform** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** entirely in **Visual Studio Code**, with the **Live Server** extension for instant browser preview during development. The platform features multiple styled pages, including a course listing page, a course detail page with embedded video lessons, and a progress tracking interface. I structured the layout using semantic HTML and styled it with custom CSS, applying Flexbox and Grid for responsive design, hover effects for interactive elements, and consistent color schemes to maintain a professional look. The video embedding was implemented using standard HTML `<iframe>` elements, ensuring compatibility across devices. Progress tracking elements, such as progress bars and completion indicators, were built using HTML/CSS and enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic updates. I used **Google Fonts** for clean typography, sourced placeholder course thumbnails and icons from free online resources, and referred to **MDN Web Docs** and **W3Schools** for quick syntax and property references. While I researched UI inspirations and design patterns through Google searches, all the structure, functionality, and styling logic were implemented by me. The result is a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing multi-page e-learning interface that simulates real-world learning platform features.**
